## file composition
1. index.py
The main file of implementation
2. test.py
For the sake of finding appropriate k value for each query, it will compare TIME.REL and output.txt files
3. run.sh

## How to run?
If run.sh doesn't have permission to be ran, type 
``` bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

and

```bash
sh run.sh
```
